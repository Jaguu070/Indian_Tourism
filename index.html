    <h1>Indian Cuisine</h1>
    <p>Famous cuisines of india</p>
    <div class="cuisine">
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <img src="/ingredients.jpg" alt="ingredients"> 
      <p>Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), tuer (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and moong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively.[29] Some pulses, such as channa or cholae (chickpeas), rajma (kidney beans), and lobiya (black-eyed peas) are very common, especially in the northern regions. Channa and moong are also processed into flour (besan).
        <br>

        Many Indian dishes are cooked in vegetable oil, but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India,[25] and coconut oil along the western coast, especially in Kerala and parts of southern Tamil Nadu.[30][self-published source?] Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma.
        <br>
        
        In recent decades, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils have become popular across India.[32] Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium.[33] Butter-based ghee, or deshi ghee, is used commonly.
        <br>
        
        Many types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton tend to be the most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.<br>
        
        
        Lentils are a staple ingredient in Indian cuisine.
        The most important and frequently used spices and flavourings in Indian cuisine are whole or powdered chilli pepper (mirch, introduced by the Portuguese from Mexico in the 16th century), black mustard seed (sarso), cardamom (elaichi), cumin (jeera), turmeric (haldi), asafoetida (hing), ginger (adrak), coriander (dhania), and garlic (lasoon). <br>
        
        One popular spice mix is garam masala, a powder that typically includes seven dried spices in a particular ratio, including black cardamom, cinnamon (dalchini), clove (laung), cumin (jeera), black peppercorns, coriander seeds and anise star.<br>
        
        Each culinary region has a distinctive garam masala blend—individual chefs may also have their own. Goda masala is a comparable, though sweet, spice mix popular in Maharashtra. Some leaves commonly used for flavouring include bay leaves (tejpat), coriander leaves, fenugreek (methi) leaves, and mint leaves. The use of curry leaves and roots for flavouring is typical of Gujarati[36] and South Indian cuisine.[37] Sweet dishes are often seasoned with cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, and rose petal essences.</p>

        <img src="/southindian .jpg" alt="regional cuisine"> 
        <P>Telugu and Andhra food is the spiciest amongst all cuisines. They use tamarind and chilli generously, hence, making the food really hot and tangy.

Other popular items include pesarattu (mung bean pancake), pulihaara (tamarind and lemon rice), thotakura (amaranth–pigeon pea stew) pappu, dosakaya (yellow cucumber – pigeon pea stew), sakinalu, rawa laddu etc.</P>

            <img src="/karnatka.jpg" alt="regional cuisine"> 
            <p>Karnataka has a diverse cuisine but the food in all is considered to be the mildest when it comes to spiciness. They use chilli, jaggery and palm sugar generously. Here the food has several subcategories-<br>

               <br>
               4- South Karnataka Cuisine is also known as the Old Mysore Cuisine where the stable food is rice and millets. The curries are thick and sweet and sour and are served with steamed rice. Mysore Pak is a popular specialty of the place.

                        <P>Vada Pav can easily be called the Indian version of a burger! A delicious, spicy, deep-fried patty made of potato is squeezed between a thick slice of bread, similar to a burger bun. Between the vada (patty) and pav (bread) a spicy mix of spices and salt is sprinkled and garnished with a fried, salted green chilli. Sounds perfect, isn't it? It's an all-day snack and is extremely popular among Maharashtrians. It is very economical, filling and easily accessible. Another popular offshoot is the Bhajiya Pav, which has batter-fried onions instead of the patty.</P>  
                        <img src="/misal paw.jpg" alt="regional cuisine">

There are various types of Misal such as Puneri Missal (topped with poha), Nagpuri Missal, Kolhapuri Missal and Mumbai Missal which are very spicy</P>
                        <img src="/modak.jpg" alt="regional cuisine">

With time, there have been varied types of modak such as Kesari modak, dark chocolate modak, motichoor modak, paneer modak, dry fruit modak and many more.
